# 📹 VideoCalling App

A simple one-to-one video calling web app built using **Agora SDK**.

## 🚀 What is it?

This is a basic implementation of a video conferencing app where users can:

- Join a video stream
- See remote users live
- Mute/unmute mic
- Turn camera on/off
- Leave the stream

## 🛠️ Tech Used

- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript** – Core structure and behavior
- **AgoraRTC SDK** – For real-time video/audio streaming
- **Responsive Design** – CSS grid and media queries

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to integrate Agora’s real-time communication API
- Managing local and remote video/audio tracks
- DOM manipulation for dynamic stream containers
- Toggle mic/cam functionality using Agora’s methods

## ▶️ Usage

1. Clone this repo
2. Add your Agora `APP_ID` and `TOKEN` in `main.js`
3. Open `index.html` in a browser
4. Click **Join Stream** to start video calling
5. Use **Mic/Camera** toggles or **Leave** anytime
